Checking the relationship between Green Space and Temperature

Description
This project analyzes the relationship between temperature and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to study Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects over the period from 2010 to 2020. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, leveraging datasets containing monthly temperature and NDVI measurements. The notebook generates a dual-axis plot to visualize trends in temperature and NDVI over time.

Dataset
The project uses two CSV files:
Temp.csv: Contains monthly temperature data with columns for Year, Month, and temp (temperature in Â°C).
NDVI.csv: Contains NDVI data with a date column (format: YYYY_MM_DD) and 132 columns representing NDVI measurements across different locations.

Dependencies

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
